M100Link test program!

(C) Retro And Gaming 2026

This beautiful piece of software is
designed to transfer actual TEXT
from your modern PC to what was the
first commercially successfull 
notebook computer, namely the TRS-80
Model 100. 

What you need:
- A TRS-80 Model 100/102 
  (or compatible)
- A modern PC with a USB to Serial 
  Adapter.
- A null modem cable - remember this
  or it will end badly i.e. not work. 
- A db9 to db25 adapter - if your 
  null modem cable doesn't magically 
  have a db25 connector on one end.
